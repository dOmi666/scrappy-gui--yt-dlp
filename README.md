## 🛠 Installing Tkinter

Tkinter usually comes bundled with Python, but on some Linux distributions you may need to install it manually:

### Ubuntu / Linux Mint (APT)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk
```

### Arch Based (Pacman)
```bash
sudo pacman -S tk
```

### TO RUN
Double click in windows select python\
or\
run the script with


```bash
python3 scrappy_gui.py
```
depends OS try this if it doesn't work;
```bash
python scrappy_gui.py
```

or make a shortcut for your OS (on Linux KDE add an application and write this to program line (make sure that where do you put this little script):

```"python $HOME/Documents/Scripts/ytdlp-video.py")```



I suggest that use " " (quotation marks) maybe your location may have a space.
